# Machine Learning Practice Repository

This repository is dedicated to practicing linear regression and logistic regression from scratch using NumPy. Feel free to explore the code and contribute to our learning journey.

## Linear Regression

### Implementation

The linear regression model is implemented using NumPy. Check out the `linear_regression.ipynb` file for details.

## Logistic Regression

### Implementation

The logistic regression model is implemented using NumPy. Explore the `logistic_regression.ipynb` file for a hands-on experience.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions and improvements! If you find any issues or have suggestions, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
